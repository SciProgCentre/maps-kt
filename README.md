This repository is a work-in-progress implementation of Map-with-markers component for Compose-Multiplatform

## [maps-kt-core](maps-kt-core)
A multiplatform coordinates representation and conversion.

## [maps-kt-compose](maps-kt-compose)
A compose multiplatform (currently desktop only, contributions of android target are welcome) implementation of a map component, features and builder.

## [maps-kt-scheme](maps-kt-scheme)
An alternative component used for the same functionality on 2D schemes. Not all features from maps could be ported because it requires some code duplication (ideas for common API are welcome).

## [demo](demo)
Demonstration projects for different features
